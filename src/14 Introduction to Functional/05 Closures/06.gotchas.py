=======

Referring to the previous example which raised an exception, one workaround is to make x mutable.  Here is
a slightly different example illustrating the point.  

In part 1, the outer function returns a pointer to the inner function.  The inner function tries to increment x,
but since
            x += 1
is really
            x = x + 1
we are incrementing by an int and hence x will have type int.  This means x is immutable which in turn means it
will be defined as a local variable. Now the right hand side of this line also refers to x.  Which x?  Is it the
outer x because of a closure or is it the local x defined on the left hand side of the line?

Local variables always take preference over closures, so x is referring to the local x.  Trouble is the local
x hasn't yet been assigned (unbound local) and hence an exception is raised.

In part 2 we store 50 in a list.  Since the list is mutable, it is captured by the closure and can be modified 
without raising an exception.
