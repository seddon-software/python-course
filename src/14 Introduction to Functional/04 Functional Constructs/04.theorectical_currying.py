Currying
========

Currying is the transformation of a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of single-argument functions.
That means converting a function like this f(a, b, c, ...) into a function like this f(a)(b)(c)... 

Currying divides your function into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility each. This makes your functions 
pure and less prone to errors and side effects.

# conventional function that takes 5 args
def func(a, b, c, d, e):
    return a, b, c, d, e

print(func(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))

# curried version where functions take 1 arg
def f(a):
    def g(b):
        def h(c):
            def i(d):
                def j(e):
                    return a, b, c, d, e
                return j
            return i
        return h
    return g
 
# f can be called in a variety of ways
a = f(1)
b = f(1)(2)
c = f(1)(2)(3)
d = f(1)(2)(3)(4)
e = f(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)

# missing arguments can be supplied later
print(a(20)(30)(40)(50))
print(b(30)(40)(50))
print(c(40)(50))
print(d(50))
print(e)
