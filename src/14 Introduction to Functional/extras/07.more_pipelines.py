More Pipelines
==============

In this more realistic example we use coroutines to filter output from the "ps -ef" command.  You will be 
prompted to search for a string that appears in the output from this command and the program then behaves 
like "grep".  For example, at the prompt enter "bash" and you will see all the bash processes currently running.

First we create a coroutine "mygrep" with
            g = mygrep(pattern)

Now we loop using our "getLine()" coroutine with 
            for line in getLine():
                match = g.send(line)

and then "send" the line to the "mygrep" coroutine.  This coroutine reads the line with
            line = f"{yield}"
            
since yield is on the right hand side of the assignment.  After checking for a pattern match, the coroutine
returns the first 120 characters of a matching line with
            yield line[:120]
