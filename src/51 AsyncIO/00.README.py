# 1. async IO is a single-threaded, single-process
# 2. uses cooperative multitasking
# 3. based around generators (or coroutines)
# 4. still may need locks for critical sections of code

# Asynchronous routines are able to “pause” while waiting on their ultimate 
# result and let other routines run in the meantime, thereby facilitating
# concurrent execution.

# To install async web library and aiohttp:
#   python -m pip install asyncio --user
#   python -m pip install aiohttp --user
