'''
tuple (immutable)
==============
Tuples are immutable arrays.  Index starts at 0 and define and access with []. 
Note that tuples wth a single item have to be defined with a comma to avoid confusion with the expression:
            x2 = (1)
'''

# define several tuples
x1 = ()
x2 = (1,)           # note the comma
x3 = (1,2,3,4,5)
x4 = (1, "mixed", 2, 'list')
x5 = ((1,2),(3,4))

# print lists
print(f"type of x1: {type(x1)}")
print(f"{x1} has length {len(x1)}")
print(f"{x2} has length {len(x2)}")
print(f"{x3} has length {len(x3)}")
print(f"{x4} has length {len(x4)}")
print(f"{x5} has length {len(x5)}")

# access elements
print(f"element 0 of x3 is {x3[0]}")
print(f"element 1 of x3 is {x3[1]}")
print(f"element 2 of x3 is {x3[2]}")

# negative indices
print(f"last element of x3 is {x3[-1]}")
print(f"last but one element of x3 is {x3[-2]}")
print(f"last but two element of x3 is {x3[-3]}")
