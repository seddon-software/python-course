'''
This example is intended to be used in the debugger.  Note we are using interactive mode:
            plt.ion()

Run the example from the command line and the program will break automatically into pdb.  Use c (=continue) to run
to the next breakpoint.  You should see the plot building up.

Then as you step through this example (by running to breakpoint) you will notice the product of the  x and y 
coordinates are plotted for a grid of points on the z=0 plane.  
        ax.plot([x,x],[y,y],[0,x*y])

The height (z=x*y) is illustrated row by row.  As the rows unfold, you can see we are forming a surface plot.
Calculations like this are the reason Numpy uses element by element calculations in expressions involving 
multi-dimemsional arrays.
