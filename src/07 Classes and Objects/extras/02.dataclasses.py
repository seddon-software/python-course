'''
DataClasses
===========

When you create a class, chances are that you want to add a number of standard dunder methods.  The @dataclass
decorator does this for you automatically.  This results in cleaner code whilst still retaining flexibility.
This idea was probably inspired by the Scala programming language.

The decorator requires the use of anotations so that it can generate the correct dunder methods, automatically 
adding generated special methods such as __init__() , __repr__() and __eq__() to user-defined classes.
