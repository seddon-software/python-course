'''
Create a class that represents a bank account.  Add methods to allow a customer to deposit() and withdraw() 
money and provide a method getBalance().

Add a static method to your class that allows transfer of funds between two different accounts.

Finally define an overdraft limit for the accounts and raise an exception if an account attempts to go 
overdrawn.

Write simple tests to check out your class.
