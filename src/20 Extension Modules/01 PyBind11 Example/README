This example creates a C/C++ extension module using scikit-build-core and pybind11.

The wheel file is built using pipx and CMake
It is installed using pip
Finally we test importing the extension module

Run:
    python build_install_and_test.py
    

To install pybind11:
    pip install "pybind11"
