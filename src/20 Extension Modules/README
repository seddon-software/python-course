These examples have 2 script files to build shared libraries and wheels:
	01 PyBind11 Example/build_install_test.py
	01 PyBind11 Example/build_shared_library.py
	02 Cython/build_install_test.py
	02 Cython/build_shared_library.py

Note: Diamond has a policy of not letting you execute code from /tmp.  This causes a problem with pipx when building wheels.  
To overcome this problem, you can change the temp directory that pipx uses with:
	mkdir ~/tmp
	export TMPDIR=~/tmp

If you get missing packages, use the commands below.  These commands will install the packages to yor home directory.

To install pybind11:
	pip install pybind11

To install cython
	pip install cython

If you get missing pybind11 config files (it shouldn't happen), the following may resolve the problem
	pip install pybind11[global]
