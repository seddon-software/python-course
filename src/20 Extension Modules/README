If there are errors mapping the shared library with pipx then it is likely to be a problem with /tmp.
You can change pipx's temp directory with:
    mkdir ~/tmp
    export TMPDIR=~/tmp


If you get missing packages, use the commands below.  These commands will install the packages to yor home directory.
To install pybind11:
    pip install pybind11

To install cython
    pip install cython

If you get missing pybind11 config files (it shouldn't happen), the following may resolve the problem
    pip install pybind11[global]
