'''
The most important point about testing is the name of the test.  The test names should be insightful, and users 
should understand the behavior and expectation of the test by just glancing at the name itself.

Note that I've included some tests that are intended to fail.  This is just done to illustrate what failures look like.

Itâ€™s easy to create custom markers or to apply markers to whole test classes or modules. Those markers can be used by plugins
and are commonly used to select tests on the command-line with the -m option.  The custom marks need to be defined in a config 
file.  I've chosen to use:
            pyproject.toml

which defines
