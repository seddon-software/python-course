Mock is designed for use with unittest. 
Mock is based on the 'action -> assertion' pattern instead of 'record -> replay' used by many mocking frameworks.

In this example we are testing the method:
            calculateChangeInSharePrice()

in the class
            Market

This method calls the 'getPrice' method of the 'Shares' class, but the 'getPrice' method is unavailable 
at the time of testing.  We can get round this by mocking out the 'getPrice' method.  There are various ways
to achieve this.
  
Here we define the 'side_effect' property of the class being mocked as a reference to our own routine that simply 
returns successive results.
