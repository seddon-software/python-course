'''
Events
======

Event objects are very similar to condition variables.  

The event object is created by:
            event = Event()

and any thread can wait on the event:
            event.wait()

All waiting threads are released when any thread "sets" the event:
            event.set()

from threading import Event, Lock

lock = Lock()

class MyClass:
    def __call__(self, name, event):
        print(f"\tthread{name} waiting for event", flush=True)
        event.wait()
        with lock:
            print(f"\tthread{name}  proceeding after event", flush=True)

event = Event()

m1 = MyClass()
m2 = MyClass()
m3 = MyClass()

t2 = Thread(target = m2, args = ("2", event))
