Numpy is a library that lets us work with multi-dimensional arrays.  Most scientific analysis packages in Python 
use Numpy. Several libraries extend Numpy including Pandas.<br>
Let's begin by creating some Numpy arrays:
<br> <br>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre class="example">
# create array filled with 1's
a = np.ones( (3,5) ); print(a)
b = np.ones( (3,5) ) * 13; print(b)

# create array filled with 0's
a = np.zeros( (3,5) ); print(a)

# create empty array
a = np.empty( (3,5), dtype=int); print(a) 

# create array from a list
a = np.array( [2,3,5,7,11,13,17] ); print(a)
a = np.array( [ [3,4],[5,6] ]); print(a)
</pre>

<h2 id="reshape">reshape</h2>    
All Numpy arrays are stored as 1 dimensional arrays, irrespective of their real dimensionality. The data in the 
array is pointed at by a structure called the "view" which contains, amongst other things, this dimensionality 
information.

In the following example we create two Numpy arrays sharing the same set of data, but having different views. The 
first array is created with "arange" and the second is a shallow copy of the first, but with its dimensionality 
changed using the "resize" function.

"arange" is Numpy's version of the range generator. And no, its not a mispelling of "arrange"; it stands for 
"array range". Where it differs from the built in "range" generator is that it can be used with floating point
numbers.

"reshape" takes an existing Numpy array and creates a new view on the same data. The idea is that the new view 
contains different dimensionality data. Since the data is unchanged, the new dimensions must contain the same 
number of data points as the original array. Thus in the example below, we start with a 1 dimensional array 
with 24 elements and reshape it to a 3 dimensional array with 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 elements. 
<br> <br>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre class="example">
import numpy as np

# create array
a = np.arange(24); print(a)
# reshape it
b = a.reshape(2,3,4); print(b)
a[13] = 99
print(a)
print(b)
# display properties held in the view
print(type(b))
print("Shape:", b.shape)
print("Dimensions:", b.ndim)
print("Size:", b.size)
print("Item type:", b.dtype.name)
print("Item size:", b.itemsize)
</pre>

<h2 id="broadcasting">broadcasting</h2>    
When operating on arrays of different sizes or dimensions, Numpy can't immediately do element by element calculations.  Instead
Numpy has to modify the input arrays such that they become the same size.  This procedure is called broadcasting.
<br>
Lets see how Numpy uses broadcasting with a one dimensional X array:
<pre>
            [1 2 3 4 5 6]
</pre>
and a two dimensional Y array (of different size from X):
<pre>
            [[1]
             [2]
             [3]
             [4]]
</pre>

Lets say we want to calculate a resulting array Z:
<pre>
            Z = (X + Y)**2 
</pre>

Numpy realizes that it needs to change X into a 2D array with the same number of rows as Y.  It therefore duplicates the first and only row of X
to create a 4 x 6 array.  The duplication is termed broadcasing.  <br>
The new array looks like:
<pre>
            [[1 2 3 4 5 6]
             [1 2 3 4 5 6]
             [1 2 3 4 5 6]
             [1 2 3 4 5 6]]
</pre>

Likewise, with Y; Numpy duplicates the first column:
<pre>
            [[1 1 1 1 1 1]
             [2 2 2 2 2 2]
             [3 3 3 3 3 3]
             [4 4 4 4 4 4]]
</pre>

Now the two arrays are both the same size (4 x 6) and Numpy can now proceed with element by element calculation, resulting in:
<pre>
            Z = [[  4   9  16  25  36  49]
                [  9  16  25  36  49  64]
                [ 16  25  36  49  64  81]
                [ 25  36  49  64  81 100]]
</pre>

If you think about it, the Z array contains the heights of the function (x + y)**2 for each point in the x, y plane.  Therefore if we plot Z
we will get a surface plot of this function.<br>

We will use matplotlib to perform the surface plot. The plot function we will use is as follows:
<pre>
            ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap)
</pre>

The X and Y parameters must both be 2 dimensional arrays that encompass all points in the xy plane that we wish to 
use in our surface plot. In our case that's the 24 points.  As we've seen the Z values  be computed from the X an Y arrays 
for each of our 24 points. The colormap is used to give artificial colors to the surface to make it easier to 
visualise.
<br> <br>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre class="example">
import numpy as np

X = np.arange(1,7)
Y = np.arange(1,5).reshape((4,1))
print(f"X=\n{X}")
print(f"Y=\n{Y}")
print(f"X has shape {X.shape}")
print(f"Y has shape {Y.shape}")

print("\nbroadcast X and Y, because arrays are different sizes and dimensions and then compute Z")
Z = (X + Y)**2 
print(f"Z=\n{Z}")
print(f"Z has shape {Z.shape}")

# now visualize the surface
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from matplotlib import cm


fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap=cm.flag)
plt.show()
</pre>
