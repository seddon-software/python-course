<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>  
Classes represents a group of objects having similar properties and behaviour.<br>
Properties are often called attributes and are represented by data.<br>
Behaviour are usually called methods or operations and are represented by functions.<br> 
<br>
Objects are created from the class definition which defines the properties and behaviour for each object.<br>
The attributes are normally defined in a constructor (initializer) as in:
<pre>
            self.x = x0
</pre>
Each object's attributes are stored in the object's dictionary<br>.
Every object in a class shares the same set of methods.  These are stored in the class's dictionary.<br>

<u>Example:</u>
<pre>
class Point:
    def __init__(self, name, x0 = 0, y0 = 0):
        ''' this is the constructor - its called automatically '''
        self.name = name
        self.x = x0
        self.y = y0
    
    def moveBy(self, dx, dy):
        self.x += dx
        self.y += dy
    
    def display(self):
        print("Point {} is at ({},{})".format(self.name, self.x, self.y))
        
# create objects
p1 = Point('point-1', 100, 200)
p2 = Point('point-2', 200, 300)
p3 = Point('point-3', 300, 500)

# call methods
p1.moveBy(1, 1)
p2.moveBy(2, 3)
p3.moveBy(3, 6)
p1.display()
p2.display()
p3.display()
</pre>
