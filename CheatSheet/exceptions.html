<h2 id="try_blocks">try blocks</h2>    
Exception handling in Python uses the following keywords:
<pre>
            try raise except
</pre>

You can mark a block of code with a try block and then the idea is that when you or library code detects an error you can raise an exception:
<pre>
            raise Exception("my error message")
</pre>

This creates an anonymous object of type Exception.  To interact with this object we need a reference to it:
<pre>
                Exception as e
</pre>
This in turn defines a pointer "e" that points to the object created above.<br>

Probably the most important thing to realise about exception handling is that once an exception is raised, code
transfers directly to the exception handler; it is a "GOTO" technology.  All remaining statements in the try block
are skipped.  Thus only the first problem is detected; there could be other undetected problems in the try block
in the code that gets skipped.  <br> <br>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre class="example">
try:
    x = 1000
    y = 0
    
    if x > 150:
        raise Exception("x is much too big")
    if x > 50:
        raise Exception("x is too big")

    print(f"x is {x}")
    print(f"x/y is {x/y}")  # division by zero error detected by Python runtime
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
</pre>

It is often the case that you need to take actions in pairs.  Good examples are opening and closing files, locking
and unlocking a mutex or starting a stopping a timer.  We say this is resource allocation and deallocation.  Bad
things happen if you allocate a resource and forget to deallocate.

Unfortunately, to err is human and programmers often fall into this trap.  This is particularly true when an
unexpected exception occurs.  To help you, Python allows you to define a "finally" block which is guaranteed to
be called even if an exception occurs.

We use the "finally" block to make sure the resource is deallocated.

<u>Example:</u>
<pre class="example">
def f(x):
    print("Locking the mutex")
    if x > 50:
        raise Exception('exception thrown')
try:
    x = 10
    f(x)
except Exception as e:
    print(f'caught exception ... {e}')
else:
    print('no exception thrown')
finally:
    print('finally block is always called ...')
    print("Unlocking the mutex")

print("End of program")
</pre>
