<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>    
Functions are introduced with the "def" keyword; parameters are placed in brackets. Functions can return values using a "return" statement.<br> 
Despite appearances, functions don't really have a name.  In the example below
"fib" is a pointer to an anonymous function.  Think of the anonymous function as a set of bytecode instructions.
<br> <br>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre>
def fib(n):  # fib is a pointer to the bytecode
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        a, b = b, a+b
    return a

print(fib(1000))    # print fibonacci number just under 1000
</pre>

<h2 id="lambdas">Lambdas</h2>
Lambda functions are an alternative to using def's to define a function.  Lambdas are expressions (not statements)
and as such can be used wherever an expression is allowed.  Lambda functions are often used as parameters to other
functions.<br>

A big difference between def's and lambda's is that the lambda is not permitted to have a function body.  This
restriction was introduced to keep lambdas simple (unlike languages like C++ where lambdas can have complex 
bodies).<br>

Lambdas define an anonymous function.  In the line<br>
<pre>
            f = lambda a, b, c, d: a + b + c + d
</pre>
the anonymous function object is assign to the pointer f.  Once this is done, the function can be called in the 
normal way:<br>
<pre>
        f(1, 10, 100, 1000)
</pre>

Note the syntax of a lambda is<br>
<pre>
        lambda <input-parameters> : <return-value>
</pre>pre>
        
which is equivalent to a def with no body:<br>
<pre>
        def <name>(<input-parameters>):
            return <return-value>
</pre>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre>
# lambda's are not allowed to have a body
# this is equivalent to the function above (minus the body)
fn = lambda a, b, c, d: a + b + c + d

# call the lambda'''
result = fn(1, 10, 100, 1000)
print(result)

# equivalent call
print((lambda a, b, c, d: a + b + c + d)(1, 10, 100, 1000))
</pre>

<h2 id="variadic_named_parameters">Variadic Named Parameters</h2>
Variadic named parameters work in a similar way to their positional counterparts.<br>

In a variadic function, the ** wraps a variable number of key-value pairs into a dict.<br>
When the passing a dict to a variadic function ** unpacks the dict before the call is made.<br>

Positional parameters are often called args:<br>
<pre>
            *args       variable number of arguments
</pre>
and key-value pairs are often called kwargs:<br>
<pre>
            *kwargs     variable number of keyword arguments
</pre>
<br>
<pre>
def volume(*args, **kwargs):    # **kwargs wraps as a dict
    print(args, type(args))
    print(type(kwargs), kwargs)
    return (kwargs['height']+2)*(kwargs['width']+10)*kwargs['depth']

myDict = { 'height':12, 'depth':20, 'width':30, 'junk':88 }
print(volume(77, 88, 99, **myDict))   # ** unpacks the dict
print(volume(width=30, height=12, depth=20))
