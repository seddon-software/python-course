<h2 id="lambdas">Lambdas</h2>
Lambda functions are an alternative to using def's to define a function.  Lambdas are expressions (not statements)
and as such can be used wherever an expression is allowed.  Lambda functions are often used as parameters to other
functions.<br>

A big difference between def's and lambda's is that the lambda is not permitted to have a function body.  This
restriction was introduced to keep lambdas simple (unlike languages like C++ where lambdas can have complex 
bodies).<br>

Lambdas define an anonymous function.  In the line<br>
<pre>
            f = lambda a, b, c, d: a + b + c + d
</pre>
the anonymous function object is assign to the pointer f.  Once this is done, the function can be called in the 
normal way:<br>
<pre>
        f(1, 10, 100, 1000)
</pre>

Note the syntax of a lambda is<br>
<pre>
        lambda <input-parameters> : <return-value>
</pre>pre>
        
which is equivalent to a def with no body:<br>
<pre>
        def <name>(<input-parameters>):
            return <return-value>
</pre>
<br>
<u>Example:</u>
<pre>
# lambda's are not allowed to have a body
# this is equivalent to the function above (minus the body)
fn = lambda a, b, c, d: a + b + c + d

# call the lambda
result = fn(1, 10, 100, 1000)
print(result)

# equivalent call
print((lambda a, b, c, d: a + b + c + d)(1, 10, 100, 1000))
</pre>
