Jupyter
=======
# Jupyter notebook is automatically installed with the module load, but Jupyter Lab insn't.
# to install jupyter lab
python -m pip install jupyterlab --user
# and then add ~/.local/bin to your PATH (in your ~/.bashrc file)

source ~/.bashrc

# jupyter lab now supports debugging (python 3.9+)

Git
===
# If you've downloaded the examples already and you want to get updates:
    git pull

# If this fails because you've made changes to some of the code, then stash your changes:
    git stash
    git pull

# Most of the examples on this course are available as a Juypter Notebook.  These are included with the above
# download of course examples.
