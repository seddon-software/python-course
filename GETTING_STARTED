Microsoft Python Plugin

# you will need to ensure the Microsoft Python extension is installed.  Search for it with:
    @id:ms-python.python
# alternatively look at recommendations:
    @recommended

Jupyter
=======
# Jupyter notebook is automatically installed with the module load, but Jupyter Lab insn't.
# to install jupyter lab
python -m pip install jupyterlab --user
# and then add ~/.local/bin to your PATH (in your ~/.bashrc file)
# and to run jupyter lab:
source ~/.bashrc
jupyter lab
# jupyter lab now supports debugging (python 3.9+)

Git
===
# If you've downloaded the examples already and you want to get updates:
    git pull

# If this fails because you've made changes to some of the code, then stash your changes:
    git stash
    git pull

# Most of the examples on this course are available as a Juypter Notebook.  These are included with the above
# download of course examples.
