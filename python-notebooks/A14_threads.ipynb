    "## What is a Thread\n",
    "A thread is a separate flow of execution through your code. This means that different threads may be running the same code at different times, but the again they may be executing entirely different code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads are used when you want to run multiple sections of code concurrently.  In most programming languages, threads can be run on different CPUs to achieve true concurrency, but often time slicing on the same CPU is used to create apparent concurrency.  When multiple CPUs are used, threading can greatly spped up code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python programs are run using CPython which is the default implementation of Python.  However, CPython is not thread safe.  What this means is that CPython creates a Global Interface Lock (GIL) each time a thread is run, effectively serialising threaded code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, threading is still useful for concurrent tasks, but your code won't necessarily run faster.  IO-bound tasks spend a lot of time waiting for data to be ready.  For these tasks there is a real speed benefit, by switching to running code in another thread, when the the current thread becomes I/O bound.  However, for CPU-bound tasks, switching threads won't speed things up because no threads are waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython has always been single threaded and it is highly unlikely that this will ever change.  PyPy is the other popular implementation of Python, but that too has a GIL.  The good news is that code that uses C/C++, Numpy or Cython may well support multithreaded CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run concurrent CPU-bound Python code, you should check out the multiprocessing module instead."

    "## 1 Creating Threads\n",
    "Recall that threads are used to perform concurrent tasks.  Threads are ultimately created by the operating system (kernel), but as far as we are concerned we make a Python call to start a thread; the Python interpreter then contacts the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a helper class to manage threads.  Rather confusingly, this class is called \"Thread\".  Objects of this class are NOT threads, just helper objects!\n",
    "\n",
    "All programs start with a single thread (often called the main thread).  When the main thread wants to create further threads, it creates objects of the helper class and calls their \"start\" method:<pre>thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "thread3.start()</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Realize that when the new threads start, they need to perform a different task (or function) from the main thread.  This task is specified as a parameter when the main thread creates the helper objects:<pre>thread1 = Thread(target=myfunc, args=(\"1\",))\n",
    "thread2 = Thread(target=myfunc, args=(\"2\",))\n",
    "thread3 = Thread(target=myfunc, args=(\"3\",))</pre>\n",
    "Creating the helper objects DOES NOT create any threads - calling the start method creates and starts a thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the \"start\" method has been called, execution of the main thread and the other threads continues in parallel.  Because the operating system may suspend threads at any time, it is not possible to predict which order code will execute unless we use special synchronization objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the main thread creates 3 other threads which all execute the \"myfunc\" function.  Each of these threads terminate when they exit this function.  I've added some random timings to emphasize the parallel nature of this program:"

    "## 3 Using Methods as Callbacks\n",
    "As an alternative, we can make the callback function a method in a class; this ultimately depends on operator overloading.  \n",

    "In the previous example the callback function was \"myfunc\" and after the \"start\" method is called, Python calls this function:<pre>myfunc()</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus Python hits the function pointer with the function call operator:<pre>( )</pre>\n",
    "\n",

    "m3()</pre>\n",
